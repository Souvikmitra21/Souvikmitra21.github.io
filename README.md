# Souvik Mitra – Academic Website

Hello, and thank you for visiting.

My name is **Souvik Mitra**. I completed my Master’s in Environmental Science (Environmental Technology) from Banaras Hindu University, and my Bachelor’s from PK Roy Memorial College, Dhanbad. My academic background has trained me in understanding sustainability, climate data, and the application of data analysis tools in environmental research.

I’ve worked on projects related to:
- Climate-smart agriculture
- Solar photovoltaic fault detection using machine learning
- Evapotranspiration partitioning using MODIS satellite data and Google Earth Engine

### Selected Publications and Presentations

- *Fault Detection in PV Grid Integrated System via Machine Learning Technology*  
  Presented at IEEE SSDEE 2025, Dhanbad. Co-authored with K. A. Chinmaya.

- *Green Building: A Way Forward to Sustainable Future*  
  Book chapter in *Contemporary Green Environmental Issues: Local to Global* (ISBN: 978-93-5747-780-2)

### Ongoing Interests

I am currently interested in using remote sensing and ecohydrological modeling to assess vegetation-climate interactions, particularly under changing climate extremes. I also enjoy working with Python, GIS tools, and data visualization platforms like Power BI.
